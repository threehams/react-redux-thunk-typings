# react-redux-thunk-typings

This is a repo which uses (gasp!) git submodules to test `redux`, and `redux-thunk` typings together. `react-redux` typings are copy/pasted since it's not worth having all of DefinitelyTyped cloned.

# Usage

Run `yarn` or `npm install` in each folder (I haven't set this up automatically yet).
`yarn test` or `npm run test` to run TypeScript tests for all three repos.
